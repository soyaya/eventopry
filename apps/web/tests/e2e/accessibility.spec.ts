/**
 * Automated accessibility regression scan for key public routes, using
 * axe-core (already exercised at the unit level in
 * `__tests__/layout-accessibility.test.ts`) driven end-to-end via
 * @axe-core/playwright against a real rendered page.
 *
 * Only "serious" and "critical" impact violations fail the build. Lower
 * severities (minor/moderate) are still logged for visibility but don't
 * fail CI — they're usually cosmetic and would otherwise create noise that
 * trains people to ignore this suite.
 *
 * If a real, unavoidable violation shows up from a third-party
 * script/embed we don't control (analytics, chat widget, payment iframe,
 * etc.), add it to KNOWN_VIOLATION_ALLOWLIST below with a comment
 * explaining why — do NOT raise/lower FAIL_ON_IMPACT to paper over it.
 * First-party violations should be fixed, not allow-listed.
