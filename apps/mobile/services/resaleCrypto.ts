/**
 * resaleCrypto.ts
 *
 * End-to-end encryption for handing a ticket's check-in secret from seller to
 * buyer during a resale (issue #1184).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Buying a ticket on-chain moves ownership, but it does not get the buyer
 * through the gate. Check-in requires the raw secret whose SHA-256 digest the
 * `ticket_payment` contract stored as the payment's `ValidationHash` (see
 * `generatePurchaseSecret` in `ticketPaymentContract.ts`). That secret lives
 * only on the original buyer's device, so a resale has to move it too — and it
 * must not be readable by the server that relays it.
 *
 * ## Scheme
 *
 * NaCl `box`: X25519 key agreement over Curve25519, then XSalsa20-Poly1305
 * authenticated encryption. The seller generates a fresh ephemeral keypair per
 * envelope, derives a shared secret against the buyer's published X25519
 * public key, and seals the ticket secret under it. Only the holder of the
 * buyer's X25519 secret key can open the result.
 *
 * A fresh ephemeral keypair per envelope means a seller's long-term key is
 * never the thing protecting a past handover.
 *
 * ## Key separation
 *
 * The buyer's encryption keypair is generated independently of their Stellar
 * signing keypair. Reusing an Ed25519 signing key for X25519 key agreement is
 * possible via birational mapping, but sharing key material across two
 * primitives is a well-known footgun, so the app keeps them separate and
 * stores the encryption secret in the device keychain via SecureStore.
 *
 * ## Randomness
 *
 * Ephemeral keys and nonces come from tweetnacl's own `randomBytes`. That is
 * the same generator the app already trusts for ticket secrets: `Keypair.random()`
 * in `ticketPaymentContract.ts` is `@stellar/stellar-base` calling into this
 * very tweetnacl instance. Do not install a custom PRNG via `nacl.setPRNG`
 * here — because the SDK shares this instance, a shim that sources entropy
 * from `Keypair.random()` recurses into itself and never terminates.
