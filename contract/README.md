# Eventopry Soroban Contracts Overview

This directory contains the Soroban smart contracts for Eventopry's on-chain event and ticketing flow.

## Tech Stack and Layout

This project uses a Rust `cargo` workspace, not Scarb. Build, test, and package management all run through the files in this directory:

- `Cargo.toml`: workspace definition for the Soroban contracts
- `contracts/event_registry`: event lifecycle, organizer controls, inventory, loyalty, staking, and governance
- `contracts/ticket_payment`: ticket purchases, escrow, refunds, settlement, transfers, auctions, and payment-side governance
- `scripts/deploy_devnet.sh`: deploys or upgrades both contracts on Stellar testnet/devnet-style environments
- `scripts/generate_coverage.sh`: generates coverage artifacts for the `ticket-payment` crate

## Contract Catalog

### `event_registry`

`event_registry` is the source of truth for event state. It stores event metadata, tier configuration, organizer ownership, inventory counters, promo settings, scanner permissions, loyalty profiles, staking records, and multi-admin governance proposals.

Key storage keys in [`contracts/event_registry/src/types.rs`](./contracts/event_registry/src/types.rs):

- `Event(event_id)`: full `EventInfo` record for an event
- `OrganizerEvent`, `OrganizerEventShard`, `OrganizerEventCount`: organizer-to-event indexes using sharded storage
- `EventReceipt`, `OrganizerReceipt*`: lightweight archived-event history
- `PlatformWallet`, `PlatformFee`, `TicketPaymentContract`, `Initialized`: core contract configuration
- `MultiSigConfig`, `ProposalCounter`, `Proposal`, `ActiveProposals`: admin governance state
- `Series`, `SeriesPass`, `HolderSeriesPass`, `SeriesEvent`: series and season-pass support
- `BlacklistedOrganizer`, `BlacklistLog`: organizer moderation and audit trail
- `AuthorizedScanner`: per-event scanner authorization
- `GuestProfile`: loyalty tracking for attendees
- `OrganizerStake`, `MinStakeAmount`, `StakingToken`, `TotalStaked`, `StakersList`: organizer staking and verification
- `TokenWhitelist`, `GlobalPromoBps`, `PromoExpiry`, `GlobalEventCount`, `GlobalActiveEventCount`, `GlobalTicketsSold`: platform-wide policy and aggregate counters

### `ticket_payment`

`ticket_payment` handles the monetary side of the platform. It validates event payment settings against `event_registry`, processes purchases, keeps escrow balances, settles platform fees, supports refunds and transfers, and emits payment-centric events for indexers and off-chain services.

Key storage keys in [`contracts/ticket_payment/src/types.rs`](./contracts/ticket_payment/src/types.rs):

- `Payment(payment_id)`: full payment record
- `EventPayment*`, `BuyerPayment*`, `EventPaymentStatus*`: sharded indexes for event, buyer, and status-based lookups
- `Balances(event_id)`: escrow and organizer/platform amounts for an event
- `Admin`, `UsdcToken`, `PlatformWallet`, `EventRegistry`, `Initialized`: base contract configuration
- `TokenWhitelist`, `OracleAddress`, `SlippageBps`: accepted assets and pricing controls
- `TransferFee(event_id)`: secondary transfer fee per event
- `BulkRefundIndex`, `PartialRefundIndex`, `PartialRefundPercentage`, `DisputeStatus(event_id)`, `IsPaused`: operational safety and refund state
- `TotalVolumeProcessed`, `TotalFeesCollected(token)`, `ActiveEscrowTotal`, `ActiveEscrowByToken(token)`: protocol-wide accounting
- `DiscountCodeHash`, `DiscountCodeUsed`: discount-code registration and redemption tracking
- `WithdrawalCap`, `DailyWithdrawalAmount`: withdrawal throttling
- `HighestBid`, `AuctionClosed`: auction state
- `Governor`, `TotalGovernors`, `Proposal`, `ProposalCount`: payment-side governance

Main responsibilities in [`contracts/ticket_payment/src/contract.rs`](./contracts/ticket_payment/src/contract.rs):

- Initializes with admin, payment token, platform wallet, and linked `event_registry` contract
- Processes ticket purchases and updates event inventory through `event_registry`
- Confirms payments and records transaction hashes
- Supports guest refunds, admin refunds, automatic refunds, bulk refunds, and partial refunds
- Tracks event escrow balances and organizer/platform settlement amounts
- Handles organizer withdrawals, platform fee settlement, revenue claims, and withdrawal caps
- Supports ticket check-in, transfers, resale fee controls, and event disputes
- Integrates optional price-oracle-based asset pricing and token whitelisting
- Supports tier auctions, bid placement, auction closeout, and governance proposals for contract parameters

## Build and Test

Run commands from [`contract/`](./).

### Build all contracts

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Run all tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Run a single contract's tests

```bash
cargo test -p event-registry
cargo test -p ticket-payment
```

### Generate coverage for `ticket-payment`

`scripts/generate_coverage.sh` expects `cargo-llvm-cov` to be installed and writes outputs under `coverage/`.

```bash
./scripts/generate_coverage.sh
```

## Deployment

The provided deployment flow is in [`scripts/deploy_devnet.sh`](./scripts/deploy_devnet.sh). It is a Bash script that:

1. Loads environment variables from `.env.devnet`
2. Builds the WASM artifacts with Cargo
3. Deploys or upgrades `event_registry`
4. Initializes `event_registry`
5. Deploys or upgrades `ticket_payment`
6. Initializes `ticket_payment`
7. Links `ticket_payment` back into `event_registry` via `set_ticket_payment_contract`

Required environment variables include:

- `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`
- `SOROBAN_RPC_URL`
- `SOROBAN_ACCOUNT_SECRET`
- `ADMIN_ADDRESS`
- `PLATFORM_WALLET`

Optional deployment inputs:

- `USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS`: existing Stellar asset contract to use for payments; otherwise the script expects you to provide or deploy a mock token separately
- `EVENT_REGISTRY_ID`
- `TICKET_PAYMENT_ID`

Typical usage:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_devnet.sh
```

Upgrade existing deployments:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_devnet.sh --upgrade
```

## Storage Model

Both contracts keep their actual `env.storage()` calls in `storage.rs` instead of scattering them across entrypoints.

- `storage.rs` acts as a thin storage access layer around Soroban persistent storage
- key creation is centralized through the `DataKey` enums in each contract's `types.rs`
- large append-only lists are sharded to avoid oversized storage entries
- counters and indexes are updated together so read paths such as "get organizer events" or "get buyer payments" stay efficient
- the payment contract stores accounting state separately from registry state, while the registry remains authoritative for event metadata and inventory

## Events

Events are defined in each contract's `events.rs` and are emitted with Soroban topics so off-chain indexers can react to contract activity.

## Contract Interaction Summary

The contracts are intentionally split by responsibility:

- `event_registry` owns event metadata, organizer policy, inventory truth, loyalty, and staking
- `ticket_payment` owns funds movement, escrow accounting, refunds, fee settlement, and purchase lifecycle
- `ticket_payment` calls into `event_registry` to read event payment settings and to increment or decrement inventory after payment state changes
