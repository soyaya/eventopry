# Event Registry Contract

A Soroban smart contract for managing event registration, ticketing, and organizer operations on the Stellar blockchain.

## Overview

The Event Registry contract provides a comprehensive decentralized event management system with the following features:

- **Event Registration**: Create and manage events with tiered pricing
- **Series Management**: Group multiple events into series with season passes
- **Multi-Sig Admin**: Configurable multi-signature administration
- **Fee Management**: Platform fees and custom event-specific fees
- **Inventory Tracking**: Real-time ticket supply management per tier
- **Event Lifecycle**: Support for active, cancelled, postponed, and archived states
- **Organizer Staking**: Collateral requirements for event organizers
- **Scanner Authorization**: Decentralized ticket verification system
- **Loyalty Program**: Track attendee loyalty scores

## Key Features

### Event Management
- Register events with customizable metadata (IPFS CID)
- Configure tiered pricing with early bird discounts
- Set maximum supply limits per event and per tier
- Update event status (active, cancelled, postponed)
- Archive events after completion

### Series & Season Passes
- Group related events into series
- Issue reusable season passes with usage limits
- Track pass holder attendance across multiple events

### Fee Structure
- Platform-wide fee percentage (basis points)
- Custom per-event fee overrides
- Fee distribution to platform wallet

### Security Features
- Multi-signature admin configuration
- Organizer blacklist management
- Address validation and authentication
- Event emission for off-chain tracking

## Data Structures

### EventInfo
```rust
pub struct EventInfo {
    pub event_id: String,
    pub organizer_address: Address,
    pub payment_address: Address,
    pub platform_fee_percent: u32,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub status: EventStatus,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub metadata_cid: String,
    pub max_supply: i128,
    pub current_supply: i128,
    pub tiers: Map<String, TicketTier>,
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### TicketTier
```rust
pub struct TicketTier {
    pub name: String,
    pub price: i128,
    pub early_bird_price: i128,
    pub early_bird_deadline: u64,
    pub tier_limit: i128,
    pub current_sold: i128,
    pub is_refundable: bool,
    // ... additional fields
}
```

### SeriesRegistry
```rust
pub struct SeriesRegistry {
    pub series_id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub event_ids: Vec<String>,
    pub organizer_address: Address,
    pub metadata_cid: Option<String>,
}
```

## Events Emitted

The contract emits events for all significant state changes:
- `ContractInitialized` - Contract initialization
- `EventRegistered` - New event registration
- `EventStatusUpdated` - Event status change
- `EventCancelled` - Event cancellation
- `EventArchived` - Event archival
- `MetadataUpdated` - Metadata update
- `FeeUpdated` - Platform fee change
- `CustomFeeSet` - Custom fee configuration
- `InventoryIncremented` - Ticket sale
- `InventoryDecremented` - Ticket refund (inventory counter only)
- `TicketRefunded` - Individual ticket refund with full details (amount, recipient, event, ticket ID)
- `GoalMet` - Sales target achieved
- `SeriesPassIssued` - Season pass creation
- And many more for staking, scanner auth, loyalty, etc.

### TicketRefunded Event Details

The `TicketRefunded` event is emitted whenever a single ticket is refunded. This event carries complete information required by the Soroban indexer to maintain an accurate off-chain ledger:

**Topics:** `(AgoraEvent::TicketRefunded,)`

**Event Structure:**
```rust
pub struct TicketRefundedEvent {
    pub ticket_id: String,           // Unique identifier of the refunded ticket
    pub event_id: String,            // Event the ticket was for
    pub recipient_address: Address,  // Guest wallet receiving the refund
    pub refund_amount: i128,         // Amount refunded in stroops (1 XLM = 10,000,000 stroops)
    pub timestamp: u64,              // Ledger timestamp when refund was processed
}
```

**Example:** When a guest requests a refund, the ticket payment contract calls the registry's `decrement_inventory`, which emits this event carrying all refund details. The indexer reads this event and updates the off-chain ledger immediately, ensuring it stays in sync with on-chain state.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar testnet access (optional for integration tests)

### Building

```bash
cd contract
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### Testing

Run unit tests:

```bash
cargo test -p event-registry
```

Run with output:

```bash
cargo test -p event-registry -- --nocapture
```

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets
```

## Integration

The Event Registry contract is designed to work with the companion [Ticket Payment](../ticket_payment/) contract. The payment contract is authorized to call inventory management functions.

### Example Usage

```rust
// Initialize the contract
let admin = Address::generate(&env);
let platform_wallet = Address::generate(&env);
client.initialize(&admin, &platform_wallet, &500); // 5% fee

// Register an event
let tiers = Map::new(&env);
tiers.set(
    String::from_str(&env, "general"),
    TicketTier {
        name: String::from_str(&env, "General Admission"),
        price: 1000_000_000, // 1000 XLM in stroops
        tier_limit: 100,
        // ... other fields
    }
);

client.register_event(&EventRegistrationArgs {
    event_id: String::from_str(&env, "event_001"),
    organizer_address: organizer.clone(),
    payment_address: organizer.clone(),
    metadata_cid: String::from_str(&env, "ipfs_cid"),
    max_supply: 100,
    tiers,
    // ... other args
});
```

## Error Handling

The contract returns `EventRegistryError` enum variants for various failure conditions:
- `NotInitialized` - Contract not initialized
- `AlreadyInitialized` - Double initialization attempt
- `EventNotFound` - Event ID doesn't exist
- `EventAlreadyExists` - Duplicate event registration
- `UnauthorizedCaller` - Missing or failed authentication
- `OrganizerBlacklisted` - Organizer is blacklisted
- `InvalidFeePercent` - Fee exceeds 100%
- `MaxSupplyExceeded` - Ticket limit reached
- `TierSoldOut` - Tier limit reached
- `EventInactive` - Event is not active
- `EventNotEnded` - Event end_time not set (required for archival)
- `InvalidDeadline` - Archival attempted before 30-day grace period
- And many more...

## Garbage Collection

### Overview

The Event Registry includes a garbage collection feature that allows organizers to archive old events and reclaim storage fees. This feature is designed to reduce long-term storage costs while preserving essential historical data.

### How It Works

When an event is archived:
1. **Full EventInfo is deleted** - All event data including tiers, milestones, tags, and configuration (~3-10 KB)
2. **Minimal EventReceipt is created** - Only essential data preserved (~200-300 bytes)
3. **Storage fees are reclaimed** - Soroban automatically returns storage deposits
4. **90-95% storage reduction** - Significant cost savings for organizers

### Requirements

To archive an event, ALL of the following must be true:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Organizer Authorization** | Only the event organizer can archive |
| **Event Inactive** | `is_active` must be `false` |
| **End Time Set** | `end_time` must be greater than 0 |
| **30-Day Grace Period** | At least 30 days (2,592,000 seconds) must have passed since `end_time` |

### Usage

```rust
// 1. Deactivate event after it concludes
client.update_event_status(&event_id, &false);

// 2. Wait 30 days after end_time

// 3. Archive the event
client.archive_event(&event_id)?;

// 4. Access receipt
let receipts = client.get_organizer_receipts(&organizer);
```

### Storage Savings

For an organizer with 100 archived events:
- **Before:** 300-1000 KB
- **After:** 20-30 KB  
- **Savings:** ~97%

- **[ARCHIVE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./ARCHIVE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick reference
- **[ARCHIVE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md](./ARCHIVE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md)** - Visual flow diagrams

### Important Notes

⚠️ **Archival is permanent and cannot be undone**

⚠️ **30-day grace period is mandatory**

✅ **Storage fees are automatically reclaimed**

✅ **Receipts can be queried via `get_organizer_receipts()`**
