## Request validation (Issue #1262)

Request DTOs in `handlers/events.rs`, `handlers/profile.rs` and
`handlers/marketplace.rs` are annotated with `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`.
Posting a JSON body that contains an unrecognised field now returns **`400
Bad Request`** (not `422`) whose message names the offending field, e.g.:

```json
{ "code": 400, "message": "unknown field `organiser_name`, there are remaining ..." }
```

All previously valid payloads continue to succeed.

## Categories caching (Issue #1260)

`GET /api/v1/categories` and `GET /api/v1/categories/:id` now send cache
headers and support conditional requests:

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, stale-while-revalidate=600`
- A weak `ETag` (SHA-256 of the serialised payload) on `200` responses.
- A client that repeats the request with a matching `If-None-Match` header
  receives **`304 Not Modified`** with an empty body.
- Error responses are marked `Cache-Control: no-store` and are never cached.

## Geo coordinate validation (Issue #1259)

`GET /api/v1/events/nearby` and `POST /api/v1/geo/geofences` validate
coordinates at the edge:

- `lat` must be finite and within `[-90, 90]`; `lng` within `[-180, 180]`.
- `NaN` / `inf` inputs are rejected.
- `radius_m` (when supplied) must be `> 0` and `<= 500000` metres (500 km).

Invalid input returns **`400 Bad Request`** naming the offending field, so a
bad request can never surface as a `500` database-constraint error.

## Graceful shutdown (Issue #1261)

The server traps `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`. On shutdown it:

1. Stops accepting new connections and drains in-flight requests for up to
   `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (default `15`).
2. Signals background tasks (Soroban indexer, waiting-room admission worker,
   nonce cleanup) to stop via a cancellation token.
3. Closes the SQLx pool and Redis connection explicitly and logs
   `shutdown complete` with the elapsed duration before exiting `0`.

Set `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS` in the environment to tune the drain window.


## Affiliate registration (Issues #1150, #1151)

`POST /api/v1/events/:id/affiliates`

Registers the authenticated wallet as an affiliate for an event and returns a
unique referral code.

**Auth:** required — the wallet is taken from the request's credentials, never
from the body, so a caller cannot register a code against someone else's
wallet.

**Response** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registered as an affiliate",
  "data": {
    "id": "0e2f...",
    "event_id": "7a41...",
    "wallet_address": "GA...",
    "referral_code": "K3M9TQ7XZ2",
    "already_registered": false
  }
}
```

**Duplicate registrations.** The call is idempotent. A wallet already
registered for the event receives its *existing* code back with
`already_registered: true`. Re-issuing a fresh code would silently invalidate
links the affiliate had already shared, and returning an error would make a
retried request look like a failure. Uniqueness of `(event_id,
wallet_address)` is enforced by the database, so two concurrent requests
cannot both create a registration.

**Errors**

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | `:id` is not a valid UUID |
| `401` | missing or invalid credentials |
| `404` | no event with that id — a code is never minted for an event that does not exist |
| `409` | a unique referral code could not be allocated; safe to retry |

**Referral codes** are 10 characters from a Crockford-style base32 alphabet
(no `I`, `L`, `O` or `U`), so a code stays unambiguous when read off a poster
or read aloud. Codes are globally unique rather than unique per event, so a
code arriving on a checkout link resolves on its own.

**Attribution.** `transactions.referred_by` carries the referral code for a
purchase made through an affiliate link. It is nullable — existing and direct
purchases simply carry no attribution — and the foreign key is
`ON DELETE SET NULL`, so removing an affiliate registration never deletes the
record of a completed purchase.
