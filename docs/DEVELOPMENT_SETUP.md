# Development Setup Guide

This is the fastest way to go from a fresh clone to a full local Eventopry development environment.

It covers all three main areas of the repo:

- `apps/web` for the Next.js frontend
- `server` for the Axum + PostgreSQL backend
- `contract` for the Soroban smart contracts

For deeper component-specific details, also see:

- [Root README](./README.md)
- [Frontend README](./apps/web/README.md)
- [Server README](./server/README.md)
- [Contract README](./contract/README.md)

## 1. Prerequisites

Install these tools before starting:

- `Node.js` and `pnpm`
- `Rust` and `cargo`
- `Docker Desktop` or Docker Engine with Compose support
- `sqlx-cli` with PostgreSQL support
- `Soroban CLI`

Recommended checks:

```bash
node --version
pnpm --version
rustc --version
cargo --version
docker --version
docker compose version
sqlx --version
soroban --version
```

Install `sqlx-cli` if you do not already have it:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

If you still need Soroban CLI, install it from the Stellar/Soroban docs before working in `contract/`.

## 2. Clone And Install Workspace Dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eventopry-Events/eventopry.git
cd eventopry
pnpm install
```

This installs the JavaScript dependencies used by the frontend workspace.

## 3. Prepare Environment Files

> **Configuration Note**: *For a comprehensive list of all backend environment variables, their defaults, required statuses, and security classifications, please refer to the [Server Configuration Reference](./server/README.md#Configuration)*.

Before starting services, review these env files:

### Required for local full-stack work

- `server/.env.example` -> create `server/.env`

PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item server/.env.example server/.env
```

Bash:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

Default local backend database value:

```text
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/eventopry
```

### Optional unless you are deploying contracts to a network

- `contract/.env.devnet.example` -> create `contract/.env.devnet`

That file is only needed for devnet/testnet deployment flows such as `scripts/deploy_devnet.sh`. It is not required just to run contract tests locally.

### Frontend env status

There is currently no frontend `.env.example` in `apps/web`, so contributors do not need to create an `apps/web/.env.local` file for the default local setup described here.

## 4. Start Infrastructure First (1-Click Startup)

The unified `docker-compose.yml` at the repo root starts PostgreSQL, Redis, Stellar RPC, backend, and frontend with a single command.

From the repo root:

```bash
make up
```

Or directly:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts the full stack with these defaults:

| Service | Container Name | Port | Environment |
|---------|---------------|------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL | `agora_postgres` | `5432` | `POSTGRES_USER=user`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password`, `POSTGRES_DB=eventopry` |
| Redis | `agora_redis` | `6379` | AOF persistence enabled |
| Stellar RPC | `eventopry_stellar_rpc` | `8000` | Test network passphrase |
| Backend (Rust) | `eventopry_backend` | `3001` | Connects to postgres + redis + stellar-rpc |
| Frontend (Next.js) | `eventopry_frontend` | `3000` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1` |

Container names and ports can be customized with environment variables (see `make help`).

To confirm all containers are running and healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Each service should report `healthy` once startup completes.

To view logs from all services:

```bash
make logs
```

To stop the stack:

```bash
make down
```

## 5. Start The Backend

Stay in `server/` and run the database migration first:

```bash
sqlx migrate run
```

This applies all migrations in `server/migrations/`, including `20260630000001_add_events_indexes.sql`, which adds indexes on `events(is_featured)` and `events(created_at DESC)` for featured-event listings.

To verify the indexes are used after migrating, seed or load events data and run:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM events WHERE is_featured = TRUE ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

The plan should show an index scan (for example on `idx_events_featured` or `idx_events_created_at`) rather than a sequential scan on large datasets.

Then start the Axum API:

```bash
cargo run
```

The backend should come up on:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

Notes:

- The server also runs embedded migrations on startup, but contributors should still run `sqlx migrate run` during setup so the database state is explicit.
- Keep this terminal open while working.

## 6. Start The Frontend

Open a new terminal, go to the repo root, and start the Next.js app from `apps/web`:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

The frontend should come up on:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If you have not already installed workspace dependencies from the repo root, do that first with `pnpm install`.

### Seed local development data

The events shown in `lib/events-store.ts` are in-memory mock data only and
never reach Postgres, so a fresh checkout starts with an empty database.
Run the frontend's seed script to populate it with ~10 sample events across
several categories (spanning past and future dates), a few organizer
profiles, and a handful of tickets:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm exec prisma db seed
```

Or, using the shortcut script:

```bash
pnpm --filter web run db:seed
```

This requires `DATABASE_URL` to be set (see `server/.env`) and the schema
to already be migrated. The seed script (`apps/web/prisma/seed.ts`) uses
`upsert` with fixed ids, so it is safe to run repeatedly -- re-running it
will not create duplicate records.

## 7. Run Contract Tests

Open another terminal and run the Soroban contract test suite:

```bash
cd contract
cargo test
```

Useful crate-specific commands:

```bash
cargo test -p event-registry
cargo test -p ticket-payment
```

Use `contract/.env.devnet` only when you are working on contract deployment scripts or remote network deployment flows.

## 8. Recommended Local Execution Order

Use this order for first-time setup:

1. Install prerequisites.
2. Run `pnpm install` from the repo root.
3. Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env` (or create `server/.env` with your local settings).
4. Run `make up` from the repo root to start the full stack.
5. Once containers are healthy, run `sqlx migrate run` from `server/` against the Docker database.
6. Start the backend with `cargo run` from `server/` if running outside Docker.
7. Start the frontend with `pnpm dev` from `apps/web/` if running outside Docker.
8. Run `cargo test` from `contract/`.

## 9. Health Verification

Once the backend is running, confirm the system is healthy with these endpoints:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health/blockchain
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health/db
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health/ready
```

What to expect:

- `/api/v1/health`: API process is up
- `/api/v1/health/blockchain`: Soroban RPC endpoint is reachable
- `/api/v1/health/db`: database connection is working
- `/api/v1/health/ready`: service is ready to serve requests

You should also be able to open:

- `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend
- `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health` for the backend

### Docker Compose healthchecks

`server/docker-compose.yml` defines container-level healthchecks so dependent
services only start once their dependencies are actually ready:

- `server`: `curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health`
- `postgres`: `pg_isready -U user -d eventopry`
- `redis`: `redis-cli ping`

The `server` service uses `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy`, so it
waits for PostgreSQL and Redis to pass their healthchecks before starting.
Verify container health with:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Each service should report a `healthy` status once startup completes.

## 10. Troubleshooting

### PostgreSQL will not start

- Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
- Check whether port `5432` is already in use by another local PostgreSQL instance.

### Migrations fail

- Confirm `server/.env` exists.
- Confirm `DATABASE_URL` matches the Docker Compose database settings.
- Make sure the Postgres container is healthy before running `sqlx migrate run`.

### Backend fails to boot

- Verify PostgreSQL is still running with `docker compose ps` in `server/`.
- Recheck `DATABASE_URL`, `PORT`, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `server/.env`.

### Frontend fails to start

- Run `pnpm install` from the repo root again.
- Confirm you are starting the app from `apps/web`.

### Contract tests fail immediately

- Confirm Rust and Cargo are installed correctly.
- Confirm Soroban CLI is installed if your contract workflow depends on it.

## 11. Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting and linting before every commit, catching issues locally before they reach CI.

### Install pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Activate hooks for this repo

Run once after cloning (or after any change to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This installs the hooks into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

### What runs on each commit

| Hook | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| `trailing-whitespace` | Removes trailing whitespace |
| `end-of-file-fixer` | Ensures files end with a newline |
| `check-merge-conflict` | Catches leftover merge conflict markers |
| `rustfmt` | Formats Rust code (`cargo fmt --check`) |
| `clippy` | Lints Rust code (`cargo clippy -D warnings`) |
| `prettier` | Formats JS/TS/CSS/JSON/MD files |
| `eslint` | Lints JS/TS files in `apps/web` |

### Run hooks manually

```bash
# Run on all files (same as CI)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run a single hook
pre-commit run rustfmt --all-files
pre-commit run eslint --all-files
```

### Auto-fix formatting before committing

```bash
# Rust
cargo fmt --all

# JS/TS/CSS/JSON/MD (from repo root)
pnpm --filter web format
```

### Skipping hooks (not recommended)

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
```

Only skip when you have a specific reason; CI will still run all checks.
