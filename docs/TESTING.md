# Testing Guide

This document covers all test layers in the Eventopry frontend — unit tests, end-to-end tests, and visual regression tests.

## Unit & Integration Tests (Vitest)

Tests live in `apps/web/__tests__/`.

```bash
# Run all unit tests once
pnpm --filter web test

# Run with coverage
pnpm --filter web test:ci
```

Coverage threshold: **80 %** on all included component files.

---

## End-to-End Tests (Cypress)

Cypress specs live in `cypress/integration/` at the repo root.

```bash
# Start the app first (separate terminal)
pnpm --filter web dev

# Run all Cypress specs headlessly
pnpm cy:run

# Open the interactive Cypress runner
pnpm cy:open
```

All backend API calls are stubbed with `cy.intercept()` — no live database required.

## Visual Regression Tests (Playwright)

### Overview

Visual snapshot tests guard the **Neubrutalist design system** (hard borders, specific drop-shadow offsets, accent colour tokens) against accidental CSS regressions.

Four core components are tested in both **light** and **dark** mode, producing **8 base snapshots**:

| Component | Light snapshot | Dark snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| `Button` | `button-light.png` | `button-dark.png` |
| `EventCard` | `event-card-light.png` | `event-card-dark.png` |
| `RegistrationBox` | `registration-box-light.png` | `registration-box-dark.png` |
| `TicketModal` (purchase) | `ticket-modal-purchase-light.png` | `ticket-modal-purchase-dark.png` |
| `TicketModal` (waitlist) | `ticket-modal-waitlist-light.png` | `ticket-modal-waitlist-dark.png` |

Snapshots are committed to `tests/visual/__snapshots__/` and diff-visible in pull request reviews.

### Setup

Playwright and its browsers are listed as dev dependencies. Install them once:

```bash
# From the repo root
pnpm install

# Install Playwright browser binaries (Chromium only, as configured)
pnpm --filter web exec playwright install chromium
```

### Running visual tests

```bash
# From apps/web — starts the Next.js dev server automatically
npx playwright test

# Or via the pnpm script shortcut
pnpm --filter web test:visual
```

### Updating base snapshots

Run this command any time you make an **intentional** design change and want to accept the new visuals as the new baseline:

```bash
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

> **Important:** Always commit the updated snapshots in the same PR as the design change so reviewers can diff the images directly in GitHub.

### Viewing the HTML report

After a test run, open the HTML report to inspect screenshot diffs:

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### How a test fails

A test fails when:

- **Pixel diff > 0.2%** between the new screenshot and the stored base snapshot.
- A **CSS design token** (e.g. `--color-accent`, `border-black`, shadow offset) changes and affects a component in the fixture page.
- The **component is not visible** (network/auth error in the fixture page).

The `Neubrutalist design tokens – runtime assertion` test group will also fail immediately — before any screenshot comparison — if:

- The `Button` loses its hard `0px` blur drop-shadow.
- The `EventCard` loses its `rgba(0,0,0)` shadow colour.

### Fixture page

The fixture page (`/apps/web/app/__visual_fixtures__/page.tsx`) renders all four components in isolation using static props — no authentication, no API calls, no routing dependencies. It is never linked from the public app and is excluded from the sitemap.

---

## CI Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/frontend.yml`) runs:

1. **Build & Lint** — `pnpm --filter web build` + ESLint
2. **Cypress E2E** — headless Cypress against the dev server
3. **Playwright Visual** — snapshot comparison (added in issue #1106)

The Playwright job uploads the HTML report and any failed screenshot diffs as CI artifacts on failure.
